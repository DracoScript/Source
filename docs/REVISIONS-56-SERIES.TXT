Changed: Food level won't decrease on GM chars anymore.
[sphere_msgs.scp]: Removed messages 'npc_text_murd_*'.
[sphere_speech.scp]: Moved hardcoded speech commands 'I must consider my sins', 'I resign from my guild' and 'I resign from my town' to scripts.
	-IMPORTANT: It's HIGHLY recommended update this script, or these speech commands will stop working.
